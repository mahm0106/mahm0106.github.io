<h1>About Me</h1>  
    <p>My name is Eeshan Mahmud. I am a 25-year-old, coming from the town of Ancaster. I am currently studying in the Interactive Media Design program (1st semester) here in Algonquin College. Prior to IMD, I’ve attended McMaster University in the Bachelor of Science program. I am currently finding ways to further educate myself and trying new things within my interests. I have always been fascinated about learning skills such as web development, photography, videography, etc. I believe these sets of skills will allow me to be flexible regardless on what career path I get into.</p>
    
    <p>Up until this point my journey hasn’t been so easy during my time in university. The lack of friends, time management, and uncertainty in life has made it difficult to get myself motivated to building a future for myself. While going through a self reflection about my past, one of the famous quotes from Winston Churchill popped up in my mind. He mentions; “Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts” (Churchill, n.d.). As I thought about this quote, I realize that it really doesn’t matter if I’m not reaching my goals after all this time. What really matters is that’s I am staying proactive by constantly educating myself and acquiring more skills. This not only shows that I am capable of growth, but this will also allow me to eventually open to new opportunities in life.</p>
