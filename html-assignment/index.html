                My name is Eeshan Mahmud. I am a 25 year old male coming from the town of Ancaster. I am currently studying in the Interactive Media Design program (1<sup>st</sup> semester) here in Algonquin College. Prior to attending the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, I’ve attended McMaster University in the Bachelor of Science program. I am currently finding ways to further educate myself and trying new things within my interests. I have always been fascinated about learning skills such as web development, photography, videography, etc. I believe these sets of skills will allow me to be flexible <em>regardless</em> on what career path I get into.

                Up until this point my journey hasn’t been so easy. The lack of friends, time management, and uncertainty in life has made it difficult to get myself motivated to building a future for myself. While going through a self reflection about my past, one of the famous quotes from Winston Churchill popped up in my mind. The quote goes as following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts”.
                </p>
                <cite>- Winston Churchil</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The more I thought about this quote, the more realized that it doesn’t matter if I’m not reaching my goals after all this time. What really matters is that’s I am staying proactive by constantly educating myself and acquiring more skills. This not only shows that I am capable of growth, but this will also allow me to eventually open to new opportunities in life.
